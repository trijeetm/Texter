# Texter

Mobile and web app to mass message lists and send direct messages to people using the Twilio API.


 
## Setup
The Texter project has two subdirectories, one containing the app and the other containing the command line tool. Clone the repository, fire up your terminal, cd into the `Texter` directory and follow the instructions below to setup the environment.

The project requires node to run, so if you don't have node installed on your machine (run `node --version` in your terminal to check if node is installed), head over [here](https://nodejs.org/download/). 


#### App


#### Command Line Tool
To run the command line tool, simply go into the directory and run the node app.
```bash
> cd cli/
> node texter.js
```
